                <p style="text-align: center;">SUMMARY: Due to the high contagiousness rate of COVID-19, many governments have decided to close their borders in order to avoid spreading the coronavirus to people in other countries. This has obviously spread to other countries and is causing more problems in the economy, the education system, among others. Many jobs are lost due to large establishments requiring less people. Students are forced to study from the "comfort" of their own homes, which causes a lot of issues among students. This article would discuss the issues and problems that it has caused on both a global and a local lens.</p>

				<h2>Burnouts in Schools</h2>
				<h4>(Some statements are from my article series in the <em>The Science Scholar</em> with Lauren Fernandez of 9-Na)</h4>

				<p>People most likely know the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23pisaygiveusabreak&src=typeahead_click">#PisayGiveUsABreak</a> since it went viral on Twitter last October. The hashtag started trending on Twitter within just twelve hours. As of October 20, 2020 at 10:00 AM, the hashtag has been tweeted over 14,000 times. This revealed numerous issues about the students’ lives inside and outside the virtual classroom.</p>
				<p>Many students spoke of how the workload was detrimental to their already unhealthy sleep schedules and how they skipped meals just to finish requirements. Others shared their experiences with taking breaks, which only led to the guilt in not doing their requirements instead. Another student talked about having environments that were not conducive to self-learning.</p>
				<p>These issues happen not only just in our school, Philippine Science High School. This also happens in many other schools. In fact, this has been reported in several nationwide articles such as the <a href="https://mb.com.ph/2020/09/04/students-say-they-have-a-hard-time-with-online-classes/">Manila Bulletin</a>, <a href="https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/10/23/20/viral-pisaygiveusabreak-shows-snags-in-learning-during-pandemic">ABS-CBN</a> and <a href="https://www.rappler.com/moveph/philippine-science-high-school-campuses-temporary-academic-breaks-student-pleas-go-viral">Rappler MovePH</a> have reported. This is due to the fact that we are all in our homes, and continue to expand narratives of us at home. Being at home obstructs us from the luxury of a weekend’s rest due to the absence of a barrier between academic and personal life.</p>
				<p>Many students have a hard time processing modules. Some don't have devices such as smartphones, tablets, or laptops in order to submit modules digitally. Even if they do, they usually don't have load to buy mobile data or to connect to the Internet.</p>
				<p>Aside from that, the online class life is very demanding. You spend around 4 hours looking at your computer every day just to attend classes (in the best case), you spend around 3 to 6 hours doing homework at the end of the day, and you probably have leisure by watching Netflix or YouTube for 2 hours. This would lead to you staring at your screen for a whopping 12 hours at most, which will make your eyes dry and hurt so badly.</p>
				<p>Also, unlike the classes in real life, you could just get so distracted during classes (since you have access to gadgets, which is a commodity that you are usually not allowed to access in face-to-face classes without getting confiscated, unless it is permitted to use for educational purposes). Now, you could access it for any reason at any time since it basically in front of you.</p>

				<h2>Financial Problems</h2>
				<p>Over the past few months in this pandemic, many companies whether big or small, had to let go of a lot of employees since they can no longer pay them. Even though the company is bombastically rich or makes a lot of money in their premises, this is not enough to make them stay. </p>

				<p>Obviously, during this pandemic, people are not allowed to go out of their homes in order to access the more private of areas such as hotels, malls, and other more private companies. Therefore, there would be less profit during this time of the pandemic (and other financial instabilities such as economic depressions) that in times of financial stability (examples of these are times before the pandemic).</p>
				<p>There are three options open to these large companies. First, they could reduce the supply of the products that they produce (for example, reduce the amount of toilet paper or canned goods that they are producing). However, since people need these goods more than ever during this pandemic, this is a less viable choice to make. The second option is to reduce the quality of their products in order to make the production rate cheaper. However, this is not viable at all since they will just more likely affect the environment negatively once they search for a way to make production as efficient as possible. Therefore, the last issue that people have to face is laying off workers as much as possible. Even though the workforce is essential to a company, people will find a way to make less people do more work for the same price.</p>
				<p>If one still see how this is not beneficial, or at worse harmful, people are literally getting less money due the costs that their companies have caused them. Basically, people earn less during this pandemic. If they do not earn less, they have no way to earn something from their job since they are already fired. They will not have resources in order to sustain themselves and their families and would cause them a lot of trouble in the long run. Even in the case where they get reparations such as stimulus checks, it will only last them a short time.</p>
				<h3>In the Global Run</h3>

				<p>There is no way to quantitatively identify the effects of the pandemic on every single person on the planet. If there were a way, it would be extremely difficult. However, as many economists have agreed on, while the pandemic is going on and possibly even after the pandemic is over. They all agree that the effects on the economy would be severe.</p>
				<p>Early estimates predicated that, should the virus become a global pandemic, most major economies (such as those of large developing and developed countries) will lose at least 2.4 percent of the value their gross domestic product (GDP) over 2020, leading economists to already reduce their 2020 forecasts of global economic growth down from around 3.0 percent to 2.4 percent. Most countries right now are experiencing economic recession, which is one of the largest historical contraction of per capital income. This can also be tied into companies losing their profits during this pandemic.</p>
				<p>In fact, to put this to estimate, the global GDP was estimated at around 86.6 trillion U.S. dollars in 2019–meaning that just a 0.4 percent drop in economic growth amounts to almost 3.5 trillion U.S. dollars in lost economic output. To put this into perspective, you could buy the Buckingham Palace in the United Kingdom with this amount of money.</p>
				<p>Since then, global stock markets have suffered dramatic falls due to the outbreak, and the Dow Jones reported its largest-ever single day fall of almost 3,000 points on March 16, 2020 – beating its previous record of 2,300 points that was set only four days earlier.</p>
				<p>In the statistics,</p>
				<div id="statistics-blockquote">
					<div id="statistics" class="three">
						<p>The forecasted GDP drop due to COVID-19 in 2020 is</p>
						<p id="data">-4.5%</p>
					</div>
					<div id="statistics" class="three">
						<p>The expected GDP drop in the best case COVID-19 scenario is</p>
						<p id="data">76.69 billion USD</p>
					</div>
					<div id="statistics" class="three">
						<p>Forecasted GDP loss in a best-case COVID-19 scenario is</p>
						<p id="data">-2.4%</p>
					</div>

				<p>For more statistics on the effects of the coronavirus on the economy in an example Asian nation (such as China), I encourage you to look at <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1102691/china-estimated-coronavirus-covid-19-impact-on-gdp-growth/">this link</a>. For even more information, one can look at the famous website <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/6139/covid-19-impact-on-the-global-economy/">Statista</a> in order to look for more information.</p>
				<p>If one does not see how these are incredibly and ultimately harmful for society, the global economy, along with other harms caused upon the planet are summarized below. However, to summarize, first, this would harm the productivity output of a lot of major companies in the planet, and second, this would harm the future of global economics and international relations especially after COVID-19. I will not be going through the information in this article due to its complexity. However, if you want more references to read in the future, take a look below. </p>
