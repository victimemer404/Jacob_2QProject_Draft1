                <p style="text-align: center;">SARS-CoV-2, more commonly known as COVID-19, is a droplet transmittable disease that has caused a lot of problems in the world today. As of October 21, 2020, there have been 41,029,279 cases and 1,129,492 deaths ever since the beginning of the spread of the disease from <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200221-coronavirus-the-harmful-hunt-for-covid-19s-patient-zero">Patient 0 documented last December 1, 2019</a>. This has caused a lot of restrictions in international and domestic flight, and other economic activities. Solutions to mitigate the pandemic have long been offered; however, many refuses to cooperate. This site discusses the issues that the pandemic has brought to us through science and society, along with the best solutions, why they are effective, and long-term effects that we can predict from science.</p>
